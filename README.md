A program designed to manage social media engagement posts for businesses

Interestingly enough, seems meta ai has blocked github action runner source ips from executing the AI. Alternatively lets clone it down for now and test locally.

I also disabled the twitter and facebook credential related stuff for now for simplicity of demo purposes. Running python script locally still works for me.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 tips_generator.py --prompt "Generate 10 interesting and insightful health tips of differing sentence lengths with no added information in your next response in a csv parsable format of date_generated,tip,hash,used. date_generated in mm/dd/yyyy format. hash should be the hash value of the tip to be inserted into the csv file using blak2b. used is just a true/false boolean field to designate if its been used before."
```

Example Outputs:

The CSV file essentially serving as our tips datastore to be utlized and added to by the program:
